Description
--------------

ClipboardManager is a lightweight productivity tool that keeps track of your clipboard changes and remembers the last clipboard entries for you. Via the left-click context menu of the notify icon you can re-copy the last clipboard entries into the clipboard again. This can be very useful in every environment where you rapidly copy and paste data. The settings and some other useful things can be accessed via the right-click context menu.
